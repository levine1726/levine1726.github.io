					<h5>Stores Infrastructure Intern</h5>
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<h6>Business/Organization: Lbrands - Mast Global Technology</h6>
					<h6>Date: May 2018 - August 2018 </h6>		
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<p>Description: While employed as an intern at Lbrands within Mast Global Technology, I was tasked with creating a store search feature within an internal MVC web application entitled the Retail Operations Center (ROC). At a high level, the store search feature allows a user to search for any Lbrands owned store and quickly get live information about the devices there. Then, depending on the user's access level, they can quickly interact with a wide variety of devices in the store: for instance, users can ping, restart, and shutdown registers with the click of a button. This feature sought to provide multiple benefits. These include, but are not limited to, allowing users to quickly gauge the health of a store’, easily interact with devices without needing to establish remote connections, and help automate tasks that the Stores Infrastructure team would need to respond to. To implement this system, I built web APIs to query information across a variety of SQL databases, retrieve Windows services using WMI, start/stop/restart Windows services using WMI, and execute remote commands. These web APIs would be accessed by a client's web browser through jQuery AJAX HTTP requests, where the HTTP response would be used to dynamically update the user’s browser. Upon finishing development, the store search feature was moved into a production environment, with multiple teams using this tool to help with troubleshooting/development.</p>

					<h5>Lasers and Robotics Laboratory Intern</h5>
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<h6>Business/Organization: University of Dayton Research Institute</h6>
					<h6>Date: May 2017 - August 2017 </h6>		
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<p>Description: I leveraged my Java skills to develop a wide variety of applications for a KUKA collaborative robotics system. The most notable of all these applications was a ‘hand guiding’ program which would allow users to physically manipulate the arm with their hands, and then record those movements for playback. The user then would have the opportunity to replay those movements while firing a laser attached to the robotic arm’s flange. This project was led independently, so it was my responsibility to communicate expectations with my supervisor and clarify what he wanted developed. Additionally, I identified additional hardware needed to run digital outputs to our laser system, and obtained the appropriate purchase orders from outside vendors. Beyond software development, I spent time playing around with Microsoft Access and working on a database to track experiments with another intern. I also had the experience to frequently practice my presentation skills by explaining my work to visitors touring our lab, even getting the opportunity to present to Boeing representatives and the University of Dayton president.</p>

					<p>Languages Utilizied: Java</p>

					<h5>Wright Scholar Summer Researcher</h5>
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<h6>Business/Organization: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)</h6>
					<h6>Date: May 2015 - July 2015 </h6>		
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<p>Description: As a Summer researcher at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), I had the opportunity to frequently run tests that would examine the air leakage of different combustion engines on a flow-bench. When I had free time, my supervisor advised me to learn VBA for Excel. Eventually, I was able to use my independent studies to create a User Defined Function (UDF) in Excel for a coworker; one which would calculate the effective area of orifices for a combustion engine. To get some of the appropriate equations for the effective area UDF, I utilized MATLAB to calculate the derivatives of some multi-variable functions.</p>

					<h5>VR Game Development</h5>
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<h6>Date: May 2017 - August 2017</h6>		
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<p>Description: During my sophomore year of undergrad, I enrolled in Ohio State’s Second-Year Transformational Program (STEP), which culminated in a fellowship funded signature project. After writing a project proposal and budget, I was able to build a VR ready PC and purchase an HTC Vive, which I used to make Virtual Reality video games. In about three months, I made two VR games with virtually no prior game development experience: a three point basketball shoot game and a procedurally generated wave shooter with an interesting teleportation mechanic. Since this was a project done over the summer while I was working full-time at one of my internships, I made an effort to set weekly development goals to stay motivated, while simultaneously working towards overarching game development milestones. Additionally, I made a website for my project and made blog posts every 8-10 days to explain what I had developed, and what bugs I had worked through. To see my entire development process documented, along with the games themselves, visit the link provided below.</p>

					<h5>Portfolio Website</h5>
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<h6>Date: May 2018 - August 2018</h6>		
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<p>Description: Since my resume is running out of space to document all my internships and extracurriculars, I wanted to make a Portfolio website to give more details and insight into my professional and personal development endeavors. As a result, I rapidly developed this website with the intention of quickly learning a new front-end CSS framework (MaterializeCSS), and also to get a better grasp about utilizing grid systems in web development in general. To simplify development, I also used Middleman and embedded ruby to generate a lot of repeated HTML code (for instance, all internships, projects, and extracurriculars entries on this site are generated from JSON files).</p>

					<h5>Warren County Property Search Freelance Project</h5>
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<h6>Date: July 2017</h6>		
					<div class="divider"></div>
					<p>Description: In the Summer of 2017, one of my friends approached me about taking on a small project for his current employer, CJS Heating and Air. Knowing that I was studying computer science at Ohio State, he inquired if I had the ability to filter and grab data from many webpages containing information about properties in Warren County, OH. Ultimately, he wanted to distribute marking information to properties with certain heating systems that his employer could service. Despite having only a little experience with HTML and no webscraping experience, I told him to contact me formally and to give me more details about what he was looking for. After clarifying expectations, spending time exploring the website I was to parse, and researching webscraping solutions, I created a software solution which would take a file of CSV values containing property information, request the actual webpage corresponding to that page using Selenium Webdriver, and would then check the type of heating system and age of the house/building on the property. If the property ending up meeting the client’s criteria, I would write the property and contact information to a CSV file. Upon finishing scraping, I was able to return the client an excel spreadsheet of over 13,500 addresses for them to market to.</p>
